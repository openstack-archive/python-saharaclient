Python bindings to the OpenStack Sahara API
===========================================

This is a client for the OpenStack Sahara API. There's a Python API (the
``saharaclient`` module), and a command-line script (``sahara``). Each
implements the OpenStack Sahara API. You can find documentation for both
Python bandings and CLI in `Docs`_.

The project is hosted on `Launchpad`_, where bugs can be filed. The code is
hosted on `Github`_. Patches must be submitted using `Gerrit`_, *not* Github
pull requests.
