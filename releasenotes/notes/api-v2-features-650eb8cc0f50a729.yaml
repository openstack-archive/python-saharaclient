    The basic saharaclient and the OSC plugin now include support for
    the enhanced boot from volume mechanism introduced in the Stein
    release of Sahara, and support for the keypair replacement
    mechanism introduced in the Rocky release of Sahara. The OSC plugin
    also now includes support for the force deletion of clusters
    feature introduced in the Queens release of Sahara, and support
    for the decommision of a specific instance feature (albeit only via
    the --json flag) introduced in the Queens release of Sahara. (All
    of these features are exclusive to Sahara's APIv2.)
