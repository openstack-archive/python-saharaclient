Contributing
============

``python-saharaclient`` is part of the Sahara project.
It has a separate `launchpad`_ page which should be used to report bugs.
Like the other projects of the OpenStack community, code contribution happens
through `gerrit`_.

Please refer to the `Sahara documentation`_ and its
`How to Participate section`_ for more information on
how to contribute to the project.
